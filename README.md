# Titanic_dataset_Using_Machine_Learning
This repo contain a random forest predictive model developed from a train titanic dataset  and tested with a test dataset collected fro kaggle. The train dataset  was first analysed to identify survivors by gender and the result was visualised using a piechart.  The analysed data was tested and used for prediction using a random forest model.
